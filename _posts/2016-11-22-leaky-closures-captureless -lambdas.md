There is a whole host of powerful closure critters that can squeeze into a captureless lambda.

![Magic](../../assets/colander.jpg)  

In my [last post](https://girishnayak12.github.io/2016/magical-captureless-lambdas/) I posited: 

> Like faeries, captureless lambdas are pure and magical creatures.  
Unlike faeries, captureless lambdas can be converted to function pointers.

Well, I lied.  

While they may be *magical*, they are not entirely *pure*.  
Alas, that is not their fault -- they are, after all, a type of C++ functions.

It turns out that even *captureless lambdas* (which are e.g. convertible to function pointers) can see, hear, sniff and *use* certain things outside their own scope in their enclosing closure!

These sneaky entities can deviously waltz right past the lambda's *empty* capture-list and appear within the lambda body.

### Types and Namespaces

Obviously, external types and namespaces are visible through the closure:
  
```cpp
struct A {};

auto f1 = []()
{
  A a1;	// A is visible
  
  struct B {}; // local struct
  
  auto f2 = []()
  {
  	A a2;             // A is visible here too
  	B b1;             // The local type B is also visible and usable
  	std::vector<A> v; // std::vector<> from the std namespace
  };  
  f2();
};
```
No surprises here, just like any C/C++ function, but extended to see local types (because as opposed to lambdas, regular C/C++ functions cannot be defined locally (though function-object types can)).  

### Functions
Similarly, functions are also accessible:

```cpp
int foo() { return 1; } // a function

auto bar = []()
{
  return foo(); // accessible here
}();
```


### Globals
Another unsurprising case is the visibility of global objects.  
Although using them is frowned upon, globals are part of our C legacy, and thus supported:

```cpp
struct Foo 
{
  int foo(){ return 0; }
};

Foo globj; // global object

namespace Bar
{
  Foo barbj; // a global within a namespace 
}

auto lambda = []()
{
  return    ::globj.foo() + // use a global object with empty capture list
         Bar::barbj.foo();  // including from within accessible namespaces
};

int (*fun_ptr)() = lambda; // conversion works
```
  
### Static Members
If both types *and* globals are accessible, then it is only logical that `static` members are also accessible:

```cpp
struct Foo
{
  static int bar; // static class member
};

int Foo::bar = 42; // define the static member (to pacify the linker)

auto lambda = []()
{
    return Foo::bar; // static member accessible here
};
```

### Constants
Often we have constant values that are known at ***compile-time***. These *too* are visible:

```cpp
int main()
{       
    const     int k1 = 1;   // a local const value - known at compile time
    constexpr int k2 = 2;   // a local const value - known at compile time
    enum        { k3 = 3 }; // a local enum - a constant value known at compile time
    
    auto f = []()
    {
        return k1 + k2 + k3; // constant values can be used here!
    };
    
    return f();
}
```
We shall return to constants in a moment.

### Ordinary Variables?

Check out this valid, [working](http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/unlBh2ltOD6Mbyf6), code:

```cpp
int main()
{       
    int x = 42;
  
    auto f = []()
    {
        return sizeof(x); // local variable `x` from external closure is visible here!!!
    };
    
    return f();
}
```

Why have lambda-captures at all if this code works!*

## Say Cheese ðŸ§€
By now, our once seemingly *pure* captureless lambdas might seem like veritable Swiss cheese.

In the code above notice that the lambda is actually returning `sizeof(x)` - a value that is known at compile time. The lambda *never* actually tries to look at the *value* of `x`. 
So this case is, in fact, like the case of the compile time constants above.

Furthermore, consider this example which seems similar to the two examples above:

```cpp
void f(int v)
{       
    const     int k1 = 1;   // a local const value - known at compile time
    constexpr int k2 = 2;   // a local const value - known at compile time
    const     int k3 = v;   // a local const value - known ONLY at run time
    int           x  = v;   // a local variable    - known ONLY at run time
  
    auto f1 = []() { return x;   }; // error: 'x' is not captured
    auto f2 = []() { return k3;  }; // error: 'k3' is not captured
    auto f3 = []() { return &k2; }; // error: lvalue required as unary '&' operand
    auto f4 = []() { return &k1; }; // error: lvalue required as unary '&' operand
}
```

Finally it is obvious that there's a limit to what can sneak into a captureless lambda.

- When `f1` tries to use the *run-time* value of `x`, an error is emitted that `x` is not captured.  
- Although `k3` is defined as `const`, its value is set at run-time and is not known at compile time, so when `f2` tries to use the *run-time* value of `k3`, an error is emitted that `k3` must be captured.  
- Even for constant variables with values known at compile time like `k2` and `k1`, if we try to reference an actual variable (i.e. address) for them (and not just the known compile-time value), we must bind and capture them in a dereferencable lvalue.

One might consider this a sufficient fix:

```cpp
    auto f1 = [&]() { return x;   }; // ok
    auto f2 = [&]() { return k3;  }; // ok
    auto f3 = [&]() { return &k2; }; // error: lvalue required as unary '&' operand
    auto f4 = [&]() { return &k1; }; // error: lvalue required as unary '&' operand
```

This is ok for `f1` and `f2` but default captures (`[&]` and `[=]`) will not bind the compile time constants `k2` and `k1` to a named (lvalue) variable automatically. To get that code to compile we must explicitly name the captured values:

```cpp
    auto f3 = [k2]() { return &k2; }; // compiles ok, but is it?
    auto f4 = [k1]() { return &k1; }; // compiles ok, but is it? 
```
or alternatively:

```cpp
    auto f3 = [&k2]() { return &k2; }; // compiles ok, but is it?
    auto f4 = [&k1]() { return &k1; }; // compiles ok, but is it?
```
This code compiles fine as the names are explicitly captured and thus valid within the lambda body.

For completeness, here's a version that does not have the subtleties mentioned above:

```cpp
auto g(const int* p) { return p ? *p : 0; }; // a function taking an address
void f(int v)
{       
    const     int k1 = 1;   // a local const value - known at compile time
    constexpr int k2 = 2;   // a local const value - known at compile time

    auto f3  = [ k2]() { return g(&k2); }; 
    auto ff3 = [&k2]() { return g(&k2); }; 
    auto f4  = [ k1]() { return g(&k1); }; 
    auto ff4 = [&k1]() { return g(&k1); }; 
}
```

## The Mysterious ODR-Use
The rules governing what entities are visible within a lambda (any lambda not just a captureless one) are formally known as ***ODR-Use***.  

Colloquially, an entity that is mentioned or *used* but is not ***ODR-used*** within the lambda body, does not need to be captured in the capture list.  

> *Informally, an object is **odr-used** if its address is taken, or a reference is bound to it.  
> [--here](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition)*

Aha! That sounds familiar, it's just what we just saw with our last example!  
Basically, as long as we don't access or require an entity's actual addressable, in-memory, run-time value we can avoid capturing it. This is very important when dealing with captureless lambdas.

Unfortunately, the standardese for ODR-Use is quite intensive and way beyond the scope of this post. For more details I found these links helpful:

1. From [cppreference.com](cppreference.com)
  - [ODR-Use](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition#ODR-use)
  - [Lambda Capture](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda#Lambda_capture)
2. From the standard: 
  - Â§3.2 [[basic.def.odr]](http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.def.odr)
  - Â§5.1.5.13 [[expr.prim.lambda]](http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.prim.lambda#13)

Now that we know about ODR-use and how to covertly smuggle stuff into captureless lambdas, we will return to the issue of using them as C API callbacks in the next post. Stay tuned.
